## Building from source

To get started you will need Java, Scala, and some other nice tools installed, luckily the Scala team has an easy setup process!

Simply follow the instructions in [this short blog](https://www.scala-lang.org/2020/06/29/one-click-install.html) to get started.

After having these installed you simply need to clone the repo, then run with `sbt run`.

And open [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

### macOS install
```
brew install scala
brew install sbt
```
